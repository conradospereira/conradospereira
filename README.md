# Hello everybody. My name is Conrado.

Backend student.

Enthusiastic about technologies and creating solutions.

A technology student and an aspiring backend developer, here I am, expressing my passion in these repositories that you present to them.

In an (I think) eternal love triangle with technology, music and cinema. A24, i love you!
